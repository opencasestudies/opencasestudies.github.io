The Open Case Studies team is excited to announce 
that case studies now have digital object identifier
(DOIs) associated with each case study that can be used 
as a citation. If you use one of the case studies in your 
classroom, we ask that you use the DOI to reference it. 

Thanks! 

The OCS Team
